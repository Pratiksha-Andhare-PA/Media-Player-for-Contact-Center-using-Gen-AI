Before that, can you please help me with your full name and complete service address with zip code.\n[2023-07-18 10:00:17 AM]Customer: sherry schultz 2514 W 21st Street, Hanford, CA 93230\n[2023-07-18 10:00:24 AM]Agent: Thank you for the information.\n[2023-07-18 10:00:26 AM]Agent: Please confirm that your phone number is 8006543215\n[2023-07-18 10:00:33 AM]Customer: Yes\n[2023-07-18 10:00:33 AM]Agent: Let me check the details of your claim.

I see your claim here. It looks like the nursing charges and administrative charges were not reimbursed. According to your policy, administrative charges are not eligible for reimbursement.\n[2023-07-18 10:00:58 AM]Customer: I understand the policy regarding administrative charges, but the nursing charges were essential for my recovery.
